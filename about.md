Located at the **[Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP)](https://lasp.colorado.edu/)** at the University of Colorado, Boulder, the IMAP SDC is responsible for science data processing and distribution of science data to the IMAP instrument teams (ITs) and the scientific community. The SDC responsibilities can be summarized as follows:

## SDC Responsibilities

- Provide oversight and coordination of the distributed IMAP data processing and data release system.
- Receive Level 0 science and housekeeping data, ancillary data, mission events, and SPICE kernels from the Mission Operations Center (MOC)/Payload Operations Center (POC) and make them available to the ITs.
- Generate Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 science products.
- Provide ITs access to all levels of science and ancillary data within 24 hours of receipt or generation at the SDC.
- Receive and manage algorithms from the ITs.
- Develop Level 1 and 2 processing software.
- Define code standards in the SDC Software [Developer Guide](https://imap-processing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development-guide/style-guide/style-guide.html) for the development of processing software.
- Assist and coordinate with ITs for higher-level code development, in accordance with the guidelines in the SDC Software Developer Guide.
- Carry out Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 science data processing, and support the automation of this processing pipeline.
- Provide integration and automation support to Combined Access and Visualization Analysis (CAVA).
- Disseminate science data products to the IMAP instrument teams via SDC web interfaces.
- Support the development of data access and visualization software for public release.
- Store all science data products for the duration of the mission.
- Deliver data archives to the SPDF during the mission for long-term archiving.

More information about the IMAP mission and its science goals can be found on the official [IMAP website](https://imap.princeton.edu). More information about the IMAP SDC can be found in the [SDC documentation](https://imap-processing.readthedocs.io).

## How to Access the Data

Data can be accessed through this website via the [data portal](https://dev.imap-mission.com/data).

Alternatively, the `imap-data-access` command-line utility and Python package provides programmatic access to query and download data. More information can be found in its [documentation](https://imap-processing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-access/index.html).
