Five instruments on the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) mission — SWAPI, CoDICE, HIT, MAG, and SWE — make in-situ space weather measurements at the Sun-Earth Lagrange Point 1 (L1) that are critical for advancing space weather research and operational forecasting. These near-real time measurements are continuously broadcast from the IMAP observatory as part of the IMAP **Active Link for Real-Time (I‑ALiRT)** space weather data system. 

The IMAP Science Data Center (SDC) at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) plays a critical role in receiving the I‑ALiRT data from NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) as well as domestic and international ground station partners. The IMAP SDC uses cloud resources from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to implement a real-time, low-latency pipeline processing architecture that includes efficient data ingestion, processing the observations into space weather data products, and providing public data access to the science research communities and space weather forecasting centers.

The I‑ALiRT space weather measurements are provided in near-real-time and therefore are uncalibrated. Individuals who wish to use the IMAP science observations for space weather science research should utilize the Level 2 and higher-level science quality data products provided through the [IMAP SDC](https://imap-mission.com//data/download) as well as NASA SPDF.
